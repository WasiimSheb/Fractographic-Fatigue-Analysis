#Automated Fractographic Analysis using Computer Vision

This repository provides a Python-based pipeline for the automated analysis of fatigue fracture surfaces in additively manufactured (AM) metal alloys. Using computer vision techniques, this project processes scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images to identify, segment, and quantify multi-phase crack growth zones, transitioning from qualitative visual inspection to reproducible, data-driven analysis.

The methodology is detailed in the paper: 

Computer Vision Methods for Fractographic Defect Detection in Titanium and Aluminum Alloys.
